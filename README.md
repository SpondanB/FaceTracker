# FaceTracker
A project to utilize the facial landmarks provided by the mediapipe library to map a face and print an avatar based on it.
<br><br>
## Requirments
The system should be able to run pygame, opencv and mediapipe.
<br><br>
## Functioning Files
Test Model: a test program to check if the landmarks are showing up or not.
<br>
Prototype Model: Used pygame to draw facial landmarks to create a prototype face in real time- FaceAvatar.py
<br><br>
## Updated version: 
This project is an older implementation of the outcome I wanted. This is my latest attempt in makeing a Virtual Avatar system [Virtual Skull Avatar](https://github.com/SpondanB/Virtual-Skull-Avatar). The final result of this repository is added in the "Old version" directory in the new repository.
